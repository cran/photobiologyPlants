#' Fluorescence emission spectra for chlorophylls.
#'
#' Optical absorption spectra of chlorophyll \eqn{a} in methanol and chlorophylls \eqn{a}
#' and \eqn{b} in diethyl ether containing the wavelengths at 1 nm interval.
#'
#' The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item A (spectral absorbance) }
#'
#' @details Data from PhotochemCAD 2.1a has been munged on 2 June 2017 by Scott
#'   Prahl (\url{https://omlc.org/}) to make the information available to
#'   non-Windows users. Although he has tried to be as careful as possible, he
#'   may have introduced some error; the cautious user is advised to compare
#'   these results with the original sources at
#'   \url{https://www.photochemcad.com/} (Du et al., 1998; Dixon et al., 2005).
#'
#'   Fluorescence emission was measured using a Spex FluoroMax. The excitation
#'   and emission monochromators were set at 1 mm, giving a spectral bandwidth
#'   of 4.25 nm.  The data interval was 0.5 nm and the integration time was 2.0
#'   sec. Samples were prepared in 1cm path length quartz cells with absorbance
#'   less than 0.1 at the excitation and all emission wavelengths to uniformly
#'   illuminate across the sample, and to avoid the inner-filter effect. The
#'   dark counts were subtracted and the spectra were corrected for
#'   wavelength-dependent instrument sensitivity.
