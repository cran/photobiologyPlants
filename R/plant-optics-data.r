#' @title Spectral optical data for 'Solidago altissima' leaves
#'
#' @description A dataset containing for wavelengths at a 1 nm interval in the
#'   range 350 to 1000 nm, tabulated values for total reflectance and total
#'   transmittance, for the upper and lower epidermis of one leaf from the upper
#'   part of a shoot and another one from the lower part.
#'
#' The variables in each spectrum are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item w.length (nm)
#'   \item Rfr
#'   \item Tfr
#' }

#' @note We thank H. M. Noda for allowing us to include these data in our
#'   package. We have included here only data for two leaves from one species
#'   (Solidago altissima) and for wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm, from the
#'   much larger original data set. The whole data set is publicly available and
#'   the data easy to read into R. The data included here where measured with a
#'   Li-Cor LI-1800 spectroradiometer equipped with a LI-1800-12 (Li-Cor)
#'   integrating sphere, and consequently are for total reflectance and total
#'   transmittance. Further details on methods are available through the JaLTER
#'   web site. If you use these data in a publication, please cite the original
#'   source as given under references and contact the original author.

#' @description A dataset containing for wavelengths at a 1 nm interval in the
#'   range 350 to 1000 nm, tabulated values for total reflectance and total

#'   ages from 'Betula ermanii' trees growing in the forest in Japan.
