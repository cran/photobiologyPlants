#' PHOT1 and PHOT2 absorbance spectra.
#'
#' A dataset containing the wavelengths at an arbitrary nm interval for plant
#' photoreceptors phototropin 1 and phototropin 2. Tabulated
#' values for the in vitro absorbance spectrum of PHOT1 LOV2 domain for
#' fluorescence yield of PHOT1 and PHOT2 from \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} measured in vitro.
#' PHOT1 fluorescence yield data were digitized from figure 1a curve
#' "LOV1 + LOV2 (WT) and PHOT2 fluorescence yield data were digitized from figure
#' 7a curve "LOV1 + LOV2 (WT) in Christie et al. (2002). PHOT1 LOV2, dark
#' adapted, spectral absorbance data were digitized from figure 3, black
#' curve and PHOT1 LOV2, blue-light adapted spectral absorbance data were
#' digitized from figure 3, blue curve in Christie et al. (2015).
#'
#' The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item A (spectral absorbance) }
