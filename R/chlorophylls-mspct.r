#' Absorbance spectra for chlorophylls.
#'
#' Optical absorption spectra of chlorophyll a in methanol and chlorophylls
#' a and by in diethyl ether containing the wavelengths at 1 nm interval.
#'
#' The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item A (spectral absorbance) }
#'
#' @details Data from PhotochemCAD 2.1a has been munged on 2 June 2017 by Scott
#'   Prahl (\url{https://omlc.org/}) to make the information available to
#'   non-Windows users. Although he has tried to be as careful as possible, he
#'   may have introduced some error; the cautious user is advised to compare
#'   these results with the original sources at
#'   \url{https://www.photochemcad.com/} (Du et al., 1998; Dixon et al., 2005).
#'
#' The spectral absorption measurements of chlorophyll a in methanol,
#' chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in diethyl ether were made by J. Li on
#' 12-11-1997 using a Cary 3. The absorption values were collected using a
#' spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, a signal averaging time of 0.133 sec, a data
#' interval of 0.25 nm, and a scan rate of 112.5 nm/min.
#'
#' Chlorophyll a measurements were scaled to make the molar extinction
#' coefficient match the value of 111700 cm-1/M at 417.8 nm.  These values were
#' then interpolated to report extinction coefficients at regular 1nm intervals.
#' The reported molar extinction coefficient is from Strain et al. (1963).
#'
#' Chlorophyll b measurements were scaled to make the molar extinction
#' coefficient match the value of 159100 cm-1/M at 453.0 nm.  These values were
#' then interpolated to report extinction coefficients at regular 1nm intervals.
#' The reported molar extinction coefficient is from Vernon and Seely (1966).
