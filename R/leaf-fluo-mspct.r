#' Fluorescence emission spectra of leaves.
#'
#' Fluroescence spectra of whole leaves of wheat excited with low irradiance of
#' UVA1 radiation at 355 nm. Fluorescence state of chlorophylls equivalent to
#' \eqn{F_0}.
#'
#' The variables of the member spectra are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item w.length (nm) \item s.e.irrad (QSEU) }
#'
#' @details Data for spectrum \code{wheat_Fo_ex355nm} from Meyer et al. (2003, Fig. 2A).
#'    The fluorescence emission is expressed in quinine sulphate equivalent units (QSEU).
#'    Data were obtained by digitizing the figure in the publication and extracting
#'    the data with DigitizeIt under Windows 11.
